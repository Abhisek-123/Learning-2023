Level-1 
1. Write a function to find biggest of 2 numbers using 
    - if else
    - ternary operator

 

2. Write a program to print the grade of the given student using if else if block
    - 90 to 100 -> "Grade A"
    - 75 to 89 -> "Grade B"
    - 60 to 74 -> "Grade C"
    - 50 to 59 -> "Grade D"
    - 0 to 49 -> "Grade F"

 

3. Write a program to read the 
    - Roll No
    - Name (Note, you should read full name of the student including initials)
    - Marks of Physics, Math and Chemistry
    Calculate the total, percentage and print the summary.

 

4. Write a simple calculator program which should accept inputs in the same order.
    - Operand 1
    - Operator
    - Operand 2
The order of scan should be same, for example, you should first scan in the following order.
printf("Enter Number1: );
Scan the first number form the user.
printf("Enter the operator: );
Scan the operator from the user.
printf("Enter Number2: );
Scan the second number form the user.

 

5. Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.
    - Set 1st bit, if operation type is 1
    - Clear 31st bit, if operation type is 2
    - Toggle 16th bit, if operation type is 3
   You can consider the below function prototype,
    - bit_operations(int num, int oper_type);

- Pointers
- Bitwise Operators


2. Write a program to swap any type of data passed to an function.

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Type Casting

 

3. Write a program to sum every alternate elements of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be 10 + 30 + 50 = 90

Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators

 

4. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits


5. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits
